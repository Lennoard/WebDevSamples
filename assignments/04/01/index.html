          Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. This, too, will pass. Peace comes
          from within. Do not seek it without. If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.

        <p>You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The
          smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. The
          past has no power over the present moment. If the facts don't fit the theory, change
          the facts.
